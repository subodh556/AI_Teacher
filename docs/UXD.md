# User Interface Design Document: AI Teacher

## Layout Structure

- **Main Layout**: IDE-inspired interface with a dark mode default theme
- **Primary Sections**:
  - Left Sidebar: Navigation tree with collapsible folders for topics/modules
  - Main Content Area: Central workspace for learning content and code exercises
  - Right Panel: Context-aware panel showing progress metrics and achievements
  - Bottom Panel: Terminal-like interface for interactive exercises and commands
- **Header**: Minimal top bar with user profile
- **Footer**: Status bar showing current progress, streak information, and system status

## Core Components

- **Topic Explorer**: File-tree style navigation organized by CS domains (Algorithms, Data Structures, etc.)
- **Code Editor**: Syntax-highlighted editor with line numbers for programming exercises
- **Output Console**: Area displaying results of code execution and system feedback
- **Assessment Interface**: Integrated quiz system with adaptive difficulty controls
- **Progress Dashboard**: GitHub-style contribution graph showing learning activity

## Interaction Patterns

- **Navigation**: Keyboard shortcuts for all actions, mirroring popular IDEs (VS Code)
- **Assessment Flow**: In-context quizzes that appear directly within learning materials
- **Feedback System**: Inline error highlighting for code exercises with contextual hints

## Visual Design Elements & Color Scheme

- **Primary Color Scheme**: Dark background (#1E1E1E) with syntax highlighting colors
  - Syntax Colors: #569CD6 (blue), #4EC9B0 (teal), #CE9178 (orange), #6A9955 (green)
  - Accent: #007ACC (bright blue for active elements and progress indicators)
- **Secondary Elements**: Status indicators using familiar colors (green for success, red for errors)
- **Progress Visualization**: Heat map calendar (GitHub-style) showing activity levels
- **Iconography**: Monochrome line icons with accent color highlights for active states
- **Dividers**: Subtle line separators (#333333) between major interface sections

## Mobile, Web App Considerations

- **Web App**: Responsive design that maintains core functionality
  - Collapsible panels to maximize screen real estate
  - Progressive Web App capabilities 
  
- **Mobile**: Simplified interface focusing on content consumption and quick practice
  - Bottom navigation bar replacing the sidebar
  - Swipe gestures for moving between related topics
  - Simplified code editor with mobile-optimized keyboard
  - Focus on review and reading rather than extensive coding

## Typography

- **Primary Font**: Monospace font (JetBrains Mono or Fira Code) for code and interface elements
- **Secondary Font**: Sans-serif font (Inter or SF Pro) for explanatory content
- **Font Sizes**:
  - Interface text: 14px
  - Code: 14px with adjustable size option
  - Headings: 18px, 16px, 14px (h1, h2, h3)
- **Line Height**: 1.5 for content, 1.2 for code blocks
- **Font Weight**: Regular (400) for most text, Medium (500) for emphasis, Bold (700) for headings

## Accessibility

- **Web Accessibility Standards**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance throughout the application
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper use of HTML5 semantic elements for improved screen reader navigation
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Complete keyboard control with visible focus states for all interactive elements
- **ARIA Attributes**: Appropriate ARIA roles, states, and properties for dynamic content
- **Responsive Text**: Text that scales appropriately with browser settings and zoom levels
- **Color Contrast**: Minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for all text content against backgrounds
- **Form Accessibility**: Clear labels, error messages, and validation for all input fields
- **Cross-Device Testing**: Ensuring accessibility features work across different devices and browsers
