# TASK-001: Project Initialization and Setup

## Priority Level
Critical

## Description
Initialize the Next.js 14+ project with TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and shadcn/ui. Set up the basic folder structure following Next.js App Router architecture and establish the development environment.

## Steps to Implement
1. Create a new Next.js project using the create-next-app CLI with TypeScript support
2. Configure TailwindCSS for styling
3. Install and configure shadcn/ui component library
4. Set up the basic folder structure following Next.js 14 App Router architecture
5. Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality
6. Set up Git repository with appropriate .gitignore file
7. Create README.md with project overview and setup instructions
8. Configure environment variables for development

## Acceptance Criteria
- Next.js 14+ project is successfully initialized with TypeScript
- TailwindCSS is properly configured and working
- shadcn/ui components are installed and accessible
- Folder structure follows Next.js App Router architecture
- ESLint and Prettier are configured and working
- Git repository is initialized with appropriate .gitignore
- README.md contains clear project overview and setup instructions
- Environment variables are properly configured

## Dependencies

## Implementation Notes
- Created a new Next.js 15.3.2 project with TypeScript, ESLint, and TailwindCSS 4.0 using create-next-app
- Configured TailwindCSS with dark mode support and custom color scheme based on the UXD document
- Installed and configured shadcn/ui with neutral color palette
- Set up the following folder structure:
  - src/app: Main application code with App Router architecture
  - src/app/api: API routes
  - src/app/auth: Authentication pages
  - src/app/dashboard: Dashboard pages
  - src/components: Reusable components including UI components from shadcn/ui
  - src/hooks: Custom React hooks
  - src/lib: Utility functions
  - src/types: TypeScript type definitions
- Created ThemeProvider and ModeToggle components for dark mode support
- Configured ESLint with additional rules for better code quality
- Added Prettier configuration for consistent code formatting
- Initialized Git repository with comprehensive .gitignore file
- Created detailed README.md with project overview, features, tech stack, and setup instructions
- Added .env.example and .env.local files with placeholder environment variables
- Verified the setup by running the development server successfully

## Status
Complete
