# TASK-012: Progress Tracking System Implementation

## Priority Level
Medium

## Description
Implement the progress tracking system as specified in the PRD document. Create a comprehensive performance tracking system with detailed analytics and visualizations.

## Steps to Implement
1. Design and implement the performance tracking data model
2. Create the analytics dashboard for visualizing progress, integrate it with the existing dashboard page.
3. Set up data aggregation and analysis for progress metrics
4. Implement data export functionality for progress data

## Acceptance Criteria
- Performance tracking data model is designed and implemented
- Analytics dashboard visualizes progress across knowledge domains, integrate it with the existing dashboard page.
- Data aggregation and analysis for progress metrics is set up
- Data export functionality for progress data is implemented

## Dependencies
- TASK-002: Supabase Integration
- TASK-004: Prisma ORM Setup
- TASK-006: Core UI Components Implementation
- TASK-009: API Endpoints Implementation

## Estimated Complexity
Medium

## Technical Requirements & Constraints
- React
- TypeScript
- Next.js
- Data visualization libraries (e.g., D3.js, Chart.js)
- PostgreSQL
- Prisma ORM

## Implementation Notes
- Enhanced the database schema with new models for progress tracking:
  - `UserGoal`: For tracking user-defined learning goals
  - `UserActivity`: For detailed tracking of user learning activities
  - `ProgressMetric`: For storing aggregated progress metrics
- Created comprehensive TypeScript types for all progress tracking models in `src/types/progress.ts`
- Implemented RESTful API endpoints for progress tracking:
  - `/api/progress/goals`: For managing user goals
  - `/api/progress/activities`: For tracking user activities
  - `/api/progress/metrics`: For storing and retrieving progress metrics
  - `/api/progress/export`: For exporting progress data
  - Enhanced existing `/api/progress` endpoints with additional functionality
- Created new UI components for progress visualization:
  - `ProgressChart`: For visualizing progress over time using Chart.js
  - `StrengthsWeaknesses`: For displaying user strengths and areas for improvement
  - `GoalTracker`: For managing user-defined learning goals
  - `ProgressExport`: For exporting progress data
  - `ProgressDashboardEnhanced`: An enhanced version of the existing progress dashboard
- Integrated the new components into the existing UI:
  - Updated the progress page with the new components
  - Enhanced the dashboard page with the new progress tracking features
- Added data export functionality for progress data in JSON format
- Implemented goal tracking with milestone celebrations
- Added time-based tracking for improvement curves
- Created detailed breakdown of strengths and areas for improvement
- Implemented progress comparison feature (to past self)

## Status
