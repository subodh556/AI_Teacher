# TASK-008: Route Implementation

## Priority Level
High

## Description
Implement the routes for the application according to the route design in the SSD document. Create the necessary pages and layouts for each route.

## Steps to Implement
1. Create the landing page with product information
2. Implement the dashboard page with progress overview
3. Set up the learning content pages for specific topics
4. Create the practice pages for interactive exercises and coding challenges
5. Implement the assessment interface pages
6. Create the progress page with detailed analytics and visualization
7. Implement the achievements page for gamification elements and badges showcase
8. Set up the settings page for user profile and preferences management
9. Configure the API routes for backend functionality

## Implementation Notes
- Created and enhanced the following routes according to the SSD document:
  - `/` - Landing page with product information, features, and call-to-action buttons
  - `/dashboard` - Main student dashboard with progress overview, recent activity, and personalized recommendations
  - `/learn/[topic]` - Learning content pages for specific topics with interactive code examples
  - `/practice/[topic]` - Interactive exercises and coding challenges with terminal interface
  - `/assessment/[id]` - Adaptive assessment interface with multiple question types and results display
  - `/progress` - Detailed analytics and progress visualization with activity history
  - `/achievements` - Gamification elements and badges showcase with progress tracking
  - `/settings` - User profile and preferences management with theme customization
- Implemented layouts for each route to maintain consistent structure
- Integrated core UI components from TASK-006 into the routes:
  - Used TopicExplorer in the learn pages
  - Used CodeEditor and TerminalInterface in the practice pages
  - Used AssessmentInterface in the assessment pages
  - Used ProgressDashboard in the progress pages
- Leveraged state management from TASK-007:
  - Used React Query for data fetching
  - Used Zustand stores for persistent state
  - Used React Context for UI state
- Created additional UI components as needed:
  - Card components for consistent layout
  - Progress component for visualizing completion
  - Input, Label, Switch, RadioGroup, and Select components for the settings page
- Added comprehensive error handling and loading states
- Ensured responsive design for all routes
- Implemented mock data fetching functions to simulate API calls
- Added detailed comments to explain complex logic
- Ensured proper navigation between routes with breadcrumbs and links

## Status
Complete
