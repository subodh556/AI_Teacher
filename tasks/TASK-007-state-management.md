# TASK-007: State Management Implementation

## Priority Level
High

## Description
Implement state management for the application using React Context API, React Query, and Zustand as specified in the SSD document. Set up server components for data fetching and rendering.

## Steps to Implement
1. Set up React Context API for global UI state
2. Configure server components for data fetching and rendering
3. Implement React Query for client-side data fetching, caching, and synchronization
4. Set up local component state for UI-specific interactions
5. Configure Zustand for complex client-side state management
6. Implement server actions for form submissions and data mutations
7. Create utility functions for state management
8. Document state management patterns for the application

## Acceptance Criteria
- React Context API is properly set up for global UI state
- Server components are configured for data fetching and rendering
- React Query is implemented for client-side data fetching, caching, and synchronization
- Local component state is properly used for UI-specific interactions
- Zustand is configured for complex client-side state management
- Server actions are implemented for form submissions and data mutations
- Utility functions for state management are created
- State management patterns are documented

## Dependencies
- TASK-001: Project Initialization and Setup
- TASK-005: Layout Structure Implementation
- TASK-006: Core UI Components Implementation

## Estimated Complexity
Complex

## Technical Requirements & Constraints
- React
- TypeScript
- Next.js
- React Context API
- React Query
- Zustand

## Implementation Notes
- Installed @tanstack/react-query and zustand packages for state management
- Created React Context API for global UI state:
  - `UIContext` in `src/context/ui-context.tsx` for managing UI layout state
- Set up React Query for data fetching and caching:
  - `QueryProvider` in `src/context/query-provider.tsx` for React Query context
  - Custom hooks for data fetching in `src/hooks/use-topics.ts`, `src/hooks/use-assessments.ts`, and `src/hooks/use-progress.ts`
- Configured Zustand for complex client-side state management:
  - `ui-store.ts` for UI state (panel visibility, theme, etc.)
  - `editor-store.ts` for code editor state (code, settings, history)
  - `assessment-store.ts` for assessment state (answers, progress, results)
  - `progress-store.ts` for progress tracking (achievements, streaks, etc.)
- Implemented server actions for data fetching and mutations:
  - API routes in `src/app/api/topics/route.ts`, `src/app/api/assessments/route.ts`, and `src/app/api/progress/route.ts`
- Created utility functions for state management in the store files
- Documented state management patterns in `docs/state-management.md`
- Updated the root layout to use the new providers
- Modified the MainLayout component to use the UI context and Zustand store
- Ensured proper synchronization between context state and Zustand store

## Status
Complete
