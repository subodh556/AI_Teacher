# TASK-015: Code Execution Environment

## Priority Level
Medium

## Description
Implement a secure code execution environment for running user code in various programming languages. Create a sandboxed environment for code execution.

## Steps to Implement
1. Research and select a code execution service or library
2. Set up a sandboxed environment for secure code execution
3. Implement support for multiple programming languages
4. Create the code execution API
5. Implement real-time error reporting
7. Create the code execution UI with input/output panels, replace the existing code editor with the newly created code execution UI.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Code execution service or library is selected and integrated
- Sandboxed environment for secure code execution is set up
- Support for multiple programming languages is implemented
- Code execution API is created
- Real-time error reporting are implemented
- Code execution UI with input/output panels is created
and replaced the existing code editor with new one.

## Dependencies
- TASK-006: Core UI Components Implementation
- TASK-009: API Endpoints Implementation

## Estimated Complexity
Complex

## Technical Requirements & Constraints
- Secure code execution service (e.g., Judge0, Piston)
- API integration
- React
- TypeScript
- Next.js

## References
- UXD.md: Core Components (lines 17-18)

## Implementation Notes
- Selected Piston API as the code execution service due to its security features, multi-language support, and ease of integration
- Created utility functions in `src/lib/code-execution.ts` for interacting with the Piston API:
  - `fetchSupportedLanguages()`: Fetches and caches the list of supported languages
  - `executeCode()`: Executes code in the specified language with input and arguments
  - `getCommonLanguages()`: Provides a list of common programming languages
- Implemented a secure API endpoint at `src/app/api/code-execution/route.ts` that:
  - Proxies requests to the Piston API
  - Implements rate limiting to prevent abuse
  - Validates input using Zod schemas
  - Handles errors gracefully
- Created a Zustand store in `src/store/code-execution-store.ts` for managing code execution state:
  - Manages code, language, input, and arguments
  - Tracks execution state and results
  - Maintains execution history
  - Persists relevant state to localStorage
- Developed UI components for the code execution environment:
  - `CodeExecutionEnvironment.tsx`: Main component that combines code editor, input panel, and output panel
  - `LanguageSelector.tsx`: Component for selecting programming language
  - `InputPanel.tsx`: Component for providing input to the code
  - `OutputPanel.tsx`: Component for displaying execution results with tabs for output, errors, and details
- Integrated the code execution environment into the existing UI:
  - Replaced the code editor in `MainContent.tsx` with the new code execution environment
  - Updated the practice page to use the new code execution environment
  - Updated the learn page to use the new code execution environment
- Implemented real-time error reporting in the output panel with separate tabs for:
  - Standard output
  - Compilation and runtime errors
  - Execution details (CPU time, memory usage, etc.)
- Added support for multiple programming languages through the Piston API
- Ensured proper error handling and user feedback throughout the execution process

## Status
Complete
