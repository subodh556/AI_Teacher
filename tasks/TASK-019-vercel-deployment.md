## Implementation Notes
- Created `vercel.json` configuration file with:
  - Build and development commands
  - Framework specification (Next.js)
  - Region configuration
  - Security headers
  - Environment variables
- Created `.vercelignore` file to exclude unnecessary files from deployment
- Updated `.env.example` with Vercel-specific environment variables:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_ANALYTICS=true`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_WEB_VITALS=true`
- Created a sample serverless function at `src/app/api/vercel-info/route.ts` that:
  - Demonstrates how to use Vercel's serverless functions
  - Shows how to access Vercel environment variables
  - Uses Edge runtime for better performance
- Implemented Vercel Analytics:
  - Added `@vercel/analytics` and `@vercel/speed-insights` packages
  - Created `src/lib/analytics.tsx` with:
    - `AnalyticsProvider` component for tracking page views
    - `trackEvent` function for custom event tracking
  - Updated `src/lib/providers.tsx` to include the `AnalyticsProvider`
- Created a comprehensive deployment guide at `docs/vercel-deployment-guide.md` with:
  - Step-by-step instructions for deploying to Vercel
  - Environment variable configuration
  - Custom domain setup
  - Analytics configuration
  - Preview deployments setup
  - Monitoring and alerts configuration
  - Troubleshooting tips
- Verified that the project is ready for deployment to Vercel
