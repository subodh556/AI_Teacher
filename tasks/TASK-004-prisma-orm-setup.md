# TASK-004: Prisma ORM Setup and Database Schema

## Priority Level
Critical

## Description
Set up Prisma ORM and define the database schema according to the ERD in the SSD document. Create migrations and seed data for development.

## Steps to Implement
1. Install Prisma in the Next.js application
2. Define Prisma schema based on the ERD in the SSD document
3. Create database migrations
4. Set up seed data for development
5. Create Prisma client instance for database operations
6. Implement utility functions for common database operations
7. Configure environment variables for database connection

## Acceptance Criteria
- Prisma is properly installed and configured
- Database schema is defined according to the ERD
- Migrations are created and can be applied successfully
- Seed data is created for development
- Prisma client instance is properly configured
- Utility functions for common database operations are implemented
- Environment variables for database connection are properly configured

## Dependencies
- TASK-001: Project Initialization and Setup
- TASK-002: Supabase Integration

## Estimated Complexity
Complex

## Technical Requirements & Constraints
- Prisma ORM
- PostgreSQL
- TypeScript
- Next.js

## References
- SSD.md: Technical Stack (lines 36-41)
- SSD.md: Database Design ERD (lines 69-145)

## Implementation Notes
- Installed Prisma CLI as a dev dependency and Prisma Client as a production dependency
- Created a Prisma schema file with models for all tables defined in the ERD
- Defined relationships between models using Prisma's relation syntax
- Created database migrations using `prisma migrate dev`
- Created a singleton Prisma client instance in `src/lib/prisma.ts`
- Implemented seed data for development in `prisma/seed.ts`
- Created utility functions for common database operations in `src/lib/prisma-db.ts`
- Configured the DATABASE_URL environment variable to use the existing Supabase PostgreSQL database
- Added the seed script configuration to package.json
- Successfully ran the seed script to populate the database with initial data

## Status
Complete
