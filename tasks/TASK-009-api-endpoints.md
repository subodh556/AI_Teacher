# TASK-009: API Endpoints Implementation

## Priority Level
High

## Description
Implement the API endpoints for the application according to the API design in the SSD document. Create RESTful API endpoints and a GraphQL endpoint for complex data queries.

## Steps to Implement
1. Set up the API route structure in Next.js
2. Implement the assessment API endpoints for quiz and assessment functionality
3. Create the learning API endpoints for content and study plan management
4. Implement the progress API endpoints for user progress tracking
5. Create the achievements API endpoints for the gamification system
6. Implement the AI API endpoints for AI-powered recommendations and explanations
7. Set up a GraphQL endpoint for complex data queries
8. Create documentation for the API endpoints

## Acceptance Criteria
- API route structure is properly set up in Next.js
- Assessment API endpoints are implemented for quiz and assessment functionality
- Learning API endpoints are created for content and study plan management
- Progress API endpoints are implemented for user progress tracking
- Achievements API endpoints are created for the gamification system
- AI API endpoints are implemented for AI-powered recommendations and explanations
- GraphQL endpoint is set up for complex data queries
- API documentation is created

## Dependencies
- TASK-001: Project Initialization and Setup

- TASK-004: Prisma ORM Setup

## Estimated Complexity
Complex

## Technical Requirements & Constraints

- SSD.md: Architecture Pattern (lines 12-17)

## Implementation Notes
- Created API utility functions in `src/lib/api-utils.ts` for common API operations
- Created validation schemas using Zod in `src/lib/validation.ts` for request validation
- Implemented RESTful API endpoints following the structure defined in the SSD document:
  - `/api/assessment/*` - Assessment API endpoints for quiz and assessment functionality
  - `/api/learning/*` - Learning API endpoints for content and study plan management
  - `/api/progress/*` - Progress API endpoints for user progress tracking
  - `/api/achievements/*` - Achievements API endpoints for the gamification system
  - `/api/ai/*` - AI API endpoints for recommendations and explanations
- Set up GraphQL endpoint at `/api/graphql` using graphql-yoga
- Created GraphQL schema in `src/graphql/schema.ts` with types and operations
- Implemented GraphQL resolvers in `src/graphql/resolvers.ts`
- Created AI utility functions in `src/lib/ai-utils.ts` for AI-powered features
- Created comprehensive API documentation in `docs/api-documentation.md`
- Ensured proper error handling and validation for all endpoints
- Used Prisma ORM for database operations in all API endpoints
- Implemented proper TypeScript typing for all API operations
- Followed RESTful API design principles with resource-based URLs
- Ensured all endpoints follow security best practices

## Status
Complete
