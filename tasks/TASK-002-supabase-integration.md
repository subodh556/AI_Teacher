# TASK-002: Supabase Integration for Database and Authentication

## Priority Level
Critical

## Description
Set up and integrate Supabase for database management, authentication, and real-time features. Configure the necessary tables and relationships according to the database design ERD.

## Steps to Implement
1. Create a Supabase project
2. Configure authentication settings in Supabase
3. Set up database tables according to the ERD in the SSD document
4. Configure row-level security policies for data protection
5. Set up real-time subscriptions for relevant tables
6. Install and configure Supabase client in the Next.js application
7. Create utility functions for database operations
8. Set up environment variables for Supabase connection

## Acceptance Criteria
- Supabase project is created and configured
