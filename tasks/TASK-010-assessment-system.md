# TASK-010: Assessment System Implementation

## Priority Level
High

## Description
Implement the assessment system as specified in the PRD document. Create an adaptive quiz interface, knowledge mapping system, and various question formats.

## Steps to Implement
1. Design and implement the adaptive quiz interface
2. Create the knowledge mapping system to identify learning gaps
3. Implement various question formats (multiple choice, short answer, problem-solving)
4. Set up the assessment data storage in PostgreSQL
5. Implement real-time feedback with contextual explanations
6. Set up the assessment results visualization


## Acceptance Criteria
- Adaptive quiz interface is implemented and adjusts difficulty based on user performance
- Knowledge mapping system identifies specific learning gaps
- Various question formats are implemented and functional
- Assessment data is properly stored in PostgreSQL
- Real-time feedback with contextual explanations is provided
- Assessment results visualization is implemented

- Added support for various question formats:
  - Multiple choice (single and multiple answers)
  - Text input with case sensitivity options
  - Coding questions with test cases
  - Problem-solving questions with step-by-step approach
- Implemented API endpoints for the assessment system:
  - `/api/assessment/adaptive` for adaptive quiz functionality
  - `/api/assessment/knowledge-map` for knowledge mapping
- Added real-time feedback with contextual explanations
- Integrated the assessment system with the existing UI
- Created a knowledge map page to visualize learning progress
- Implemented difficulty adjustment based on user performance
- Added support for identifying knowledge gaps based on assessment results
- Ensured proper error handling and validation for all API endpoints
- Added comprehensive comments to explain complex logic

## Status
Complete
