# TASK-006: Core UI Components Implementation

## Priority Level
High

## Description
Implement the core UI components as specified in the UXD document. Create reusable components for the topic explorer, code editor, terminal interface, output console, assessment interface, and progress dashboard.

## Steps to Implement
1. Create the topic explorer component with file-tree style navigation
2. Implement the code editor component with syntax highlighting and line numbers
3. Create the terminal interface component for executing code
4. Implement the output console component for displaying results
5. Create the assessment interface component
6. Implement the progress dashboard component with GitHub-style contribution graph
7. Ensure all components follow the design system and are responsive
8. Create storybook documentation for each component

## Acceptance Criteria
- Topic explorer component is implemented with file-tree style navigation
- Code editor component has syntax highlighting and line numbers
- Terminal interface component allows executing code
- Output console component displays results
- Assessment interface component
- Progress dashboard component shows learning activity with GitHub-style contribution graph
- All components follow the design system and are responsive
- Storybook documentation is created for each component

## Dependencies
- TASK-001: Project Initialization and Setup
- TASK-005: Layout Structure Implementation

## Estimated Complexity
Complex

## Technical Requirements & Constraints
- React
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- shadcn/ui
- Monaco Editor or CodeMirror for code editor
- XTerm.js or similar for terminal interface

## Implementation Notes
- Created six core UI components as specified in the UXD document:
  - `TopicExplorer.tsx`: File-tree style navigation component with collapsible folders
  - `CodeEditor.tsx`: Code editor component using Monaco Editor with syntax highlighting and line numbers
  - `TerminalInterface.tsx`: Terminal interface component using XTerm.js for executing code
  - `OutputConsole.tsx`: Output console component for displaying execution results
  - `AssessmentInterface.tsx`: Assessment interface component for quizzes with multiple question types
  - `ProgressDashboard.tsx`: Progress dashboard component with GitHub-style contribution graph
- Implemented dynamic imports for browser-only libraries (XTerm.js, react-calendar-heatmap) to avoid SSR issues
- Created TypeScript types for all components in `src/types/core-components.ts`
- Added utility functions for the code editor and terminal in `src/lib/editor-utils.ts` and `src/lib/terminal-utils.ts`
- Created mock data for testing components in `src/lib/mock-data.ts`
- Integrated all components into the existing layout structure:
  - TopicExplorer in the Sidebar
  - CodeEditor and AssessmentInterface in the MainContent
  - TerminalInterface and OutputConsole in the BottomPanel
  - ProgressDashboard in the RightPanel
- Ensured all components follow the design system with dark mode support
- Made components responsive and accessible
- Added comprehensive comments to explain complex logic
