## Implementation Notes
- Created a new layout directory in `src/components/layout` with the following components:
  - `MainLayout.tsx`: The main layout component that integrates all other layout components
  - `Sidebar.tsx`: The left sidebar component with collapsible folders and navigation tree
  - `MainContent.tsx`: The main content area component for learning content
  - `RightPanel.tsx`: The right panel component for progress metrics and achievements
  - `BottomPanel.tsx`: The bottom panel component for terminal-like interface
  - `Header.tsx`: The header component with user profile, search, and authentication controls
  - `Footer.tsx`: The footer component with progress, streak information, and system status
- Implemented responsive design with collapsible panels for different screen sizes
- Set dark mode as the default theme
- Added mock data for the navigation tree, progress metrics, and achievements
- Implemented a functional terminal-like interface in the bottom panel
- Created an index.ts file to export all layout components
- Updated the root layout to use the new MainLayout component
- Simplified the dashboard layout to avoid duplicate headers
- Integrated sign-in, sign-up, and profile functionality in the Header component
- Added a dropdown menu for user profile with links to profile, settings, and sign out that appears on click
- Implemented click-outside detection to close the profile menu when clicking elsewhere
- Improved accessibility by adding proper ARIA labels and button types
- Ensured the layout is responsive and works on different screen sizes
